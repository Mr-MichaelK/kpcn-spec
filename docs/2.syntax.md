# Syntax Specification
<u>**Note:**</u> KPCN is case-sensitive. All language keywords must be written in uppercase.

## 1. Variable Declaration:

### Rule:
```VAR varName = value```

### Purpose:
To declare a local variable and assign it a value. The **VAR** keyword declares a variable by its name, while the = operator assigns it a value.

### Example:
```
VAR name = "Michael"
```

### Python Translation:
```python
name = "Michael"
```

## 2. Global Variables:

### Rule:
```GLOBAL VAR varName = value```

### Purpose:
To declare a global variable (can be accessed from anywhere) and assign it a value. The GLOBAL keyword is used to make a variable global upon its declaration. The GLOBAL keyword is used inside functions.

### Example:
```
GLOBAL VAR counter = 0
```

### Python Translation:
```python
# inside some function
global counter
counter = 0
```

## 3. Data Types:

Data types represent the kind of value a variable holds. In KPCN, data types are inferred automatically and do not need to be explicitly declared by the user. This keeps the syntax clean and intuitive.

KPCN data types fall into two main categories:

### Primitives:
Primitives are the basic building blocks of data. In KPCN, primitive types mirror those found in Python:

- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans
- NULL

#### 1. Strings:
A string represents a sequence of text characters surrounded by double quotes ("").

In KPCN, a string variable may look as such:
```
VAR someString = "I am a string"
```

#### 2. Numbers:
A number represents both integers and floating point numbers.

In KPCN, number variables may look as such:
```
VAR age = 19
VAR PI = 3.14
```

#### 3. Booleans:
A boolean represents a logical value of either TRUE or FALSE.

In KPCN, boolean variables may look as such:
```
VAR isHungry = TRUE
VAR isFull = FALSE
```

#### 4. Null:
NULL is a special value representing the absence of data. It's useful for initializing variables before assigning real values:

In KPCN, we can create a NULL object as such:
```
VAR person = NULL
```

### Non-primitives:
Non-primitive data types are types defined by the programmer which represent real-world objects.

Some non-primitives such as lists, sets, and maps may be provided by the language itself.

For example, we can create a non-primitive type like the Student class which is defined using the CLASS keyword (more on that later) and instantiated with its CONSTRUCTOR function.

We declare such a variable like this:
```
VAR student1 = Student("Michael", 19)
```
which creates a new student whose name is Michael and age is 19. In this case, name and age would be attributes defined using the ATTRIBUTE keyword inside the student class.
