# Syntax Specification
<u>**Note:**</u> KPCN is case-sensitive. All language keywords must be written in uppercase.

## 1. Variable Declaration:

### Rule:
```VAR varName = value```

### Purpose:
To declare a local variable and assign it a value. The **VAR** keyword declares a variable by its name, while the = operator assigns it a value.

### Example:
```
VAR name = "Michael"
```

### Python Translation:
```python
name = "Michael"
```

## 2. Global Variables:

### Rule:
```GLOBAL VAR varName = value```

### Purpose:
To declare a global variable (can be accessed from anywhere) and assign it a value. The GLOBAL keyword is used to make a variable global upon its declaration. The GLOBAL keyword is used inside functions.

### Example:
```
GLOBAL VAR counter = 0
```

### Python Translation:
```python
# inside some function
global counter
counter = 0
```
