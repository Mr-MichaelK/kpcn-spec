# KPCN Translator Specification

## Overview

This document outlines how the KPCN pseudocode language should be translated into Python code. It defines translation rules, expected behaviors, and special handling for ambiguous or AI-dependent constructs.

## Objectives

- Convert well-structured KPCN code into valid, idiomatic Python.
- Resolve syntactic differences (e.g., `FUNCTION` to `def`, `ATTR` to instance variables).
- Leverage AI/NLP for comment-driven code generation.
- Handle errors gracefully and report any unresolved translations.

## Scope

The translator supports the complete KPCN language syntax as defined in the specification, including:
- Variables
- Functions
- Classes
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Error handling
- Comments and AI-guided instruction
- Inheritance and `SUPER`

## Core Translation Rules

| KPCN Keyword     | Python Equivalent     | Notes |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| VAR              | Implicit (type-less)  | `VAR x = 5` → `x = 5` |
| FUNCTION         | `def`                 | Add parameters, body indentation |
| CLASS            | `class`               | Convert constructors and methods |
| ATTR             | `self.attr =`         | Inside constructor |
| STATIC ATTR      | Class variable        | `ClassName.attr = ...` |
| CONSTRUCTOR      | `__init__`            | Called as `ClassName(...)` |
| METHOD           | `def` with self       | Bound method |
| STATIC METHOD    | `@staticmethod`       | No `self` parameter |
| IF / ELSE IF     | `if` / `elif`         | Translate logic |
| ELSE             | `else`                | Must follow `if` or `elif` |
| TRUE / FALSE     | `True` / `False`      | Capitalization |
| FOR / WHILE      | Python equivalents    | Needs range or iterable parsing |
| TRY / CATCH      | try / except          | Match error message |
| ASSERT           | `assert`              | Translate natural language if needed |
| THROW            | `raise`               | Use exceptions |
| EXTENDS          | `class ... (...)`     | Multi-inheritance supported |
| SUPER            | `super()`             | Dispatch to parent |
| this             | `self`                | Must be inside method |
| RETURN           | `return`              | Same |
| COMMENTS         | `#` or instruction    | Sent to NLP model for logic generation |

## AI/NLP Handling

Instructive comments (imperative tone) must be extracted and sent to an LLM for implementation. Examples include:
- // use the url to call the backend → generate requests call
- // return the sum of all elements in arr → implement logic

Fallback behavior: If a comment cannot be translated to code, insert a placeholder function with a `pass` and comment.

## Translation Modes

- Strict Mode: Only direct translations, no inference.
- AI Mode: Uses instructive comments to generate full blocks.

## Limitations

- No runtime execution; output is static code.
- Cannot resolve overly ambiguous or contradictory comments.
- Assumes structurally valid KPCN.

## Future Work

- Add support for custom types and modules
- Integrate test-case generation from comments
- Enable live preview in browser or IDE plugin
