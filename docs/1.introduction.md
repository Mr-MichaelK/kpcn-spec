# Introduction
## Definition
Kolanjian Pseudocode Notation (KPCN for short) is a form of pseudocode notation named after myself, created in an effort to establish a fixed and consistent pseudocode syntax.

KPCN is a human-readable pseudocode dialect written by humans and translated by AI into Python. It combines a structured syntax with natural language comments to express logic clearly and concisely.

## Vision
Since it is difficult to standardize pseudocode universally, creating a specific notation—like a dialect of a spoken language—helps ensure that pseudocode is interpreted in a consistent and unambiguous way.

Often when generative AI is prompted to produce code, the output differs from what the user intended. This isn't always due to AI hallucination; it can also stem from ambiguous, overly brief, or poorly structured prompts. KPCN combines formal pseudocode with natural language comments to bridge the gap between AI and humans, allowing programmers to write specific prompts without needing to specify implementation details. These details are expressed narratively in the comments and left for the AI to infer.

KPCN emphasizes clarity of intent. It is translated—not compiled—so that developers can focus on conveying their ideas rather than implementing them. Implementation is the AI’s responsibility; describing the logic is the programmer’s.

Translation, rather than compilation, makes the language implementation-independent and flexible across platforms. Unlike compiled languages, which require platform-specific binaries, KPCN is intended to be translatable to any programming language. In its first version, the target output is Python.

KPCN is not executable. Instead, it is translatable. A KPCN (.kpcn) file is processed by an AI model, which outputs a Python (.py) file. The AI is expected to translate the pseudocode directly and implement the logic described in the accompanying natural language comments.

## Goals
1. Bridge the gap between human-AI communication in code generation.

2. Establish a consistent and understandable pseudocode notation.

3. Encourage idea specification over manual implementation.

4. Enable flexible translation of KPCN to various programming languages.
